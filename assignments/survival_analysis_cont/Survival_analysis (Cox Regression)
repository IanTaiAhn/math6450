Attached are the two data sources and the notebook we discussed in class.

Project Objective: 
Calculate conditional probabilities of employee departure at specific tenure milestones (weeks 1-12) for different employee cohorts grouped by location (state) and job type using a Survival Model.

You may use Cox model or other suitable survival model.

What You Need to Calculate: For each week of tenure (weeks 1 through 12), determine:
 * P(leaving | employee has X weeks tenure AND is from a specific state)
 * P(leaving | employee has X weeks tenure AND has a specific job type)

Grouping Requirements:

By Location:
 * Calculate probabilities for the top 5 states individually
 * Calculate one combined probability for all remaining states

By Job Type:
 * Calculate probabilities for each job type

Example Calculations for Week 1:
 * P(leaving | 1 week tenure AND employee from Utah)
 * P(leaving | 1 week tenure AND employee in job_type_1)
 * Continue for all top 5 states, remaining states combined, and all job types

Repeat this analysis for weeks 2 through 12.

Final Dataset Structure: Your final dataset should contain these columns:

Week number	State 1	                State 2	                State 3	                State 4             	State 5	                Rest of states      	Job type 1	            Job type 2	            Job type 3
